# Bonfire
Bonfire is going to be an instant messaging desktop application intended for use by small (20-30 people) groups of friends. It will have features such as text messaging, voice chat, groups, text/voice channels, posting embedded images, and assigning tags to users in groups. The main intent of Bonfire is to be as secure and privacy-focused as possible, while maintaining a seamless user experience. Users should experience zero friction from the point where they log in to, for example, where they want to send a message to someone. This means that there will be no ads, pop-ups, or other attention-grabbing mechanisms to divert the user from what they actually want to do. 

## Technologies
Bonfire is an Electron + Vite application. The front-end is built with React + Vite, and Supabase is used as the backend. We may move away from utilizing Supabase to store user information once we find a way to make the app more P2P. We're also using vanilla CSS. 

## Research
Bonfire's design will be informed by current research.
